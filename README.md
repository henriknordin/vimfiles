## Installation

Enter the directory that should contain the installation. It is not important where, since the 
bootstrap.sh script will generate the required symlinks. The following oneliner will set up
the working environment.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/henriknordin/vimfiles.git && ./vimfiles/bin/bootstrap.sh
```
